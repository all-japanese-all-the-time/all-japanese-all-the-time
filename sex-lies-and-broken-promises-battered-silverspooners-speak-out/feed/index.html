					<description><![CDATA[Still don&#039;t get why it is limited to like 7 slots. The only reason I can think of why it would be so limited is if you actually spend a significant amount of one-on-one time instructing people. If it is simply a daily email thingy that tells you what to do, then why so limited?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I kinda wanna join this just to see the learning process and how Khatz is doing it, but knowing that a) I&#039;m far enough along now that I don&#039;t really NEED to and b) there are people that want in a lot more than I do, I&#039;ll probably pass.

Having said that, if the info given can apply to Mandarin, or if a Mandarin edition will come in the future...  I think I&#039;ll be in at some point, probably after I graduate.  I&#039;ve loved doing Japanese the AJATT way but I&#039;ve definitely been SLOW with it.  Gotta hone my mental faculties and drop English more I think, where I can (this has been very easy in Japan, not quite so (mentally) easy before I came here).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[SilverSpoon seems great, but it is just not for me. I&#039;ve been going hard (Sadly, there have been days without learning, still reviewed and immersed) And i am proud with my progress. A mere 2 months ago i couldn&#039;t understand any spoken japanese and now i am up to understanding 30-50% of an Anime. 

Plus, i think it will be valuable if i do this myself, never have been so committed before/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Meh, I&#039;ve been eating from the bronze spoon for 9 years and it worked just the same. I&#039;m glad I switched over to my own hand-picked gold spoon though.

When I am living in Japan and speaking with other students and studying many subjects in Japanese, and living, breathing, and pooping Japanese, then I&#039;ll get the platinum spoon!]]></description>
